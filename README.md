# CS731-Blacklisting-URL-using-HyperLedger-Composer

This project aims at developing an URL blacklisting system in blockchain using HyperLedger com-
poser. Our work focuses on blacklisting malicious urls within an organizational network(consider a
network of users in an University). This will prevent the users within the organization from falling
in victim of phishing attacks and downloading malwares which will result in infecting the large
part of the network. In conventional systems the blacklisting urls within an organization solely
depends on the network administrator but here we tried to develop this system using blockchain
so that we do not have to put our trust on the network administrator. The solution is developed
for particular organization so using permissioned blockchain will be more useful.
